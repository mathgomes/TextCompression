So no one told you life was gonna be this way [four claps]
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but...

*CHORUS*
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to fall)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

Your still in bed at 10 and work began at 8
You burned your breakfast so far, things are going great.
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these.
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees. And,

*CHORUS*
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

no one could ever know me
no one could ever see me
since your the only one who knows what its like to be me.
Someone to face the day with, make it through all the mess with.
Someone I'll always laugh with, even in my worst I'm best with you. yeah

[music]

its like you're always stuck in second gear
when it hasnt been your day, your week, your month, or even your yearrrrr

*CHORUS*
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

*CHORUS*
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)
